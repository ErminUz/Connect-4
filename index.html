          <h5>The game is played on a board which has seven hollow columns and rows. <br>
              The board consists of 42 windows made up of 6 rows and 7 columns. <br>
              Each player takes turns in placing their coins in chosen columns, <br> 
              the coin will be placed in first empty container closest to the bottom of the board. <br>
              Both players start out with 21 coins, with individual colors. <br>
              The goal is for the players to connect their placed coins <br>
              so that they create a unbroken chain - diagonally, horizontally or vertically.
